    catalog doesn't store data for historical modules
  - make Last-Modified work on streaming content

RhaptosModuleStorage-0.40.1
  - Previous fix for content-type overrides the type set in
    module_export_template, to the effect of providing wrong encoding;
    respect already-set response fields (#8584).
    The noticed problem was in printing.

RhaptosModuleStorage-0.40
  - more ModuleFile extension, this time for content-type (mimetype) (#8486)

    a separate db connection

    commented-out changes to make ModuleView portal_type different from
    RhaptosModuleEditor portal_type. See #8190.

RhaptosModuleStorage-0.37
  - cnxml-0.6 (30 Jan 2009)
    - set proper Last-Modified and Content-Length headers on module contents
    - short circuit REQUESTs that are either HEAD or If-Modified-Since, to avoid creating
      File objects if no bits are to be sent, anyway.

RhaptosModuleStorage-0.36
  - integrate w/ RhaptosPrintTool, storing PDFs, rather than regenerating on the fly

RhaptosModuleStorage-0.35.3

ModuleStorage-0.35.1
  - default to not storing in CVS

ModuleStorage-0.35

ModuleStorage-0.34.3
  - keep up with changes to VersionFolder.notifyObjectRevised interface introduced
    in RhaptosRepository 0.69 (due to #6343)
